                      A minty fresh breeze blows gently from a sculpture carefully covered in toothpaste. Using the tube as a painting tool, various objects got a new appearance through the thick soft paste which erodes the surface of the objects.
                      There are everyday materials like bottles, shower heads, stickers, artificial fur, a bikini, a pear, that are put together in a totally different context.
                      Their former function is subverted in order to create something new. The specific selection of objects leads to two assumptions
                      about their origin: The artist must have a huge cellar or is an Willhaben-addict/flea market lover/collector with a strong feeling for the agency of things." color="F2DEFF" position="-3 1.5 -4" scale="0.2 0.2 0.2" animation="property: position; to: -1.7 1.76 -1; dur: 6000; easing: linear; loop: false"></a-text>

                  It also reflects a certain spirit of the time to use materials that existed already and let them tell their own story. In that sense the more or less skillfully put together sculptures also question the idea of the artist as a genius, who only is able to create a masterpiece. The concept of learning is just as easily underrun, as the toothpaste tube is used in its original function."

                        With that critical but also really humorous way of creating, the works gather a certain lightness and simplicity that spread out over the room, despite their modest scale.
                        Sometimes there is even a moment of absurdity in it, for example when a comic donkey sticker is visible or a pear chills in a bikini."

                      The claim of reality seems like a game in that world but eccentric titles might lead a way out.
                      Everything is a suggestion or offers you a way of understanding. But there is not really something to understand — an experiment, and you decide if i succeeds or fails. Maybe it is more about the failing.
                      The work is just an outcome from constant research and exploring. But that would neglect the undeniably aesthetic intuitive choices the artist makes.
                      Not only aesthetically but also with the attempt to be as close to the outside world the actions move somehow between artistic and quotidian experience.
                      The most trivial or ordinary action, like applying toothpaste, comes to its peak when toothpaste is displaced from the bathroom in the artist’s studio."

                                  The studio as the place where the magic happens, also brought us together to collaborate.
                                  When I stored my cat’s grave stone over summer at her studio, the stone appeared after a while in her new work.
                                  We continued working on it together, made very small conscious choices and finished it by drilling a hole and putting a glitter stone from last night's drag party."

                      Looking at it proudly we had a conversation about the work: ‘What to do with the
works afterwards? Do you store it? Or Should we sell it? I wouldn’t sell it for less
than 50.000€.

Maybe you can give it to your mum as a Christmas gift.’"
