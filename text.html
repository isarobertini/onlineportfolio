                      A minty fresh breeze blows gently from a sculpture carefully covered in toothpaste.
                      Using the tube as a painting tool, various objects got a new appearance through the
                      thick soft paste which erodes the surface of the objects. There are everyday
                      materials like bottles, shower heads, stickers, artificial fur, a bikini, a pear, that are
                      put together in a totally different context. Their former function is subverted in order
                      to create something new. The specific selection of objects leads to two assumptions
                      about their origin: The artist must have a huge cellar or is an Willhaben-addict/flea
                      market lover/collector with a strong feeling for the agency of things." color="#007C90" position="-3 1.5 -4" scale="0.2 0.2 0.2" animation="property: position; to: -1.5 2 -1; dur: 6000; easing: linear; loop: false"></a-text>

                  It also reflects a certain spirit of the time to use materials that existed already and let them tell their own story. In that sense the more or less skillfully put together sculptures also question the idea of the artist as a genius, who only is able to create a masterpiece. The concept of learning is just as easily underrun, as the toothpaste tube is used in its original function."
